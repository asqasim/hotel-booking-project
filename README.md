# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction  
**IDS f24 – Introduction to Data Science Semester Project**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Hotel booking cancellations are a major challenge for the hospitality industry, leading to revenue loss and inefficient resource planning.  
This project aims to **analyze booking patterns** and **predict whether a hotel reservation will be canceled or checked-in** using machine learning.

The project covers the **full data science lifecycle**:
- Data understanding and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Machine Learning model training  
- Interactive deployment using Streamlit  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations  
- Perform detailed exploratory data analysis with visual insights  
- Train and evaluate a **Random Forest classification model**  
- Build an interactive web application for real-time predictions
